# TensorFlow-ConvNeXtV2Block
A straightforward implementation of a ConvNeXtV2 Block in Keras, TensorFlow, based on [this paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Woo_ConvNeXt_V2_Co-Designing_and_Scaling_ConvNets_With_Masked_Autoencoders_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf). The official implementation in PyTorch is available [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ConvNeXt-V2).

**Attention! The algorithm cannot be fully accelerated by graphical hardware on Mac M-series devices, especially, and the training process can be rather slow.**
